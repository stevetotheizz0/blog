Philadelphia's Wards:<br /><br />Philadelphia's smallest level of elected offices are its ward leaders.&nbsp; Wards play a principle role during elections as its leaders receive and distribute street money from each party's campaign funds.&nbsp; Ward leaders also perform other roles behind the scenes that allow them to serve vital functions within the political system.<br /><br />Within each ward are further subdivisions called Ward Divisions.&nbsp; Why is this important?&nbsp; During each primary voters choose who their candidates will be for various offices.&nbsp; However voters also choose their representatives, committee persons, within each ward division.&nbsp; The ward division committees get together before the general election and choose by vote who the leader for that ward will be.&nbsp; Each ward has two ward leaders, one for each party. So if you are a Republican or Democrat, you will elect your own committee person for your party.&nbsp; In 2014 the ward committees were elected in the May primaries and they subsequently elected their leaders for each ward in June of 2014.&nbsp; <br /><br />How easy is it to get elected as a ward division leader?&nbsp; Sometimes it can be incredibly easy.&nbsp; In the 2014 primary a number of divisions elected a committee person through just 1 vote, that contained a write-in candidate.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; One person walked into the polls, wrote their name on a piece of paper and got elected to something.<br /><br />The second map below tracks those who were elected via write-in.&nbsp;&nbsp; These candidates either wrote themselves in themselves and were elected or had a few others write their names in as well to win. <br /><br />Below is a map of all the districts and highlighted in red are the ward divisions that elected their leader by just 25 votes or less.&nbsp; If you could grab 25 friends or supporters and walk into a poll on primary day, you'd have a shot at being elected to participate in Philadelphia's political process.<br /><br />58th ward (in the far northeastern corner of the city boundary) was the leading division that had the most write-ins and 18 out of its 34 divisions elected committee persons with 25 votes or less.<br /><br />If you wanted to get started with being involved behind the scenes of the Philadelphia political process, grab some friends during the primary and write-yourself in.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iczQhn5nugk/U73ijdg8LtI/AAAAAAAAAlo/V12HB4-Hj20/s1600/WardElection.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iczQhn5nugk/U73ijdg8LtI/AAAAAAAAAlo/V12HB4-Hj20/s1600/WardElection.jpg" height="640" width="494" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />
