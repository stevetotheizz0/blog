Summer is finally here which means a little more free time and some extra pep in my step from the weather and sunshine. &nbsp;I'm hoping to make ground on a couple projects. &nbsp; One for fun and another to build off mapping and data visualization and put it all on the web in an interactive format. <br /><br /><br />Here's a preview of the progress on my current "for fun" project:<br /><br />Every city is filled with variety and history wherever you look. &nbsp;From the cornices and windows, to architecture, even in something as simple as a sewer cover. &nbsp;After a few weeks of hunting around I've gotten about halfway to my goal of finding between 60 and 100 different sewer covers. &nbsp;When I'm done I'll touch them up and make a few prints of the collage.<br /><br />One of my favorites that I find pretty frequently is the PTC cover. &nbsp;These are from the pre-Septa days when the Philadelphia Trolley Company was still in town.<br /><br />Finding the second half will probably be a summer long scavenger hunt but I'll gladly take any excuse to bike around in the sun.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HSZ84IwjJdE/VV4W0ySh8cI/AAAAAAAABkk/ehR89M9VDDc/s1600/SewerCollage.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HSZ84IwjJdE/VV4W0ySh8cI/AAAAAAAABkk/ehR89M9VDDc/s320/SewerCollage.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />
