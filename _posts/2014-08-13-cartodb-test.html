<html lang="en"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="520" mozallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" src="https://stevetotheizz0.cartodb.com/viz/4b8bc316-2319-11e4-94ec-0e10bcd91c2b/embed_map" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="100%"></iframe></html> The image above was a test to try out CartoDB within Blogger.&nbsp; Blogger is pretty restrictive with the active content and compatible plugins.&nbsp; I found that other free javascript plugins like leaflet will not function in Blogger but CartoDB is an option that will work.<br /><br />The map shown is simply an export of the Democratic Ward Committee Elections data from the previous post.&nbsp; CartoDB offers some simply map options with its free membership.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll have some time to play around with this tool later and see if there is any additional functionality that can be added.
