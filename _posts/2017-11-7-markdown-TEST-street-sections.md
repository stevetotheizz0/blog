summary: I am testing out how markdown files feed into the blog pages using Jekyll. All of the previous posts were just html files that were exported from blogspot and formatted slightly to fit into the Jekyll framework. This will be the part of the transition to a more static locally hosted group of content.

I am testing out how markdown files feed into the blog pages using Jekyll. All of the previous posts were just html files that were exported from blogspot and formatted slightly to fit into the Jekyll framework. This will be the part of the transition to a more static locally hosted group of content.

Now that I have Jekyll up and running I should be able to start adding some regular content back into this site, which will be nice. Also, on one hand its been about a year since I updated things, but over that year I started working at SGA, finished the project with Ardmore, and have done a few other things that I can add into my blog posts.

Hopefully I can have a lot of content uploaded, and fix all the little things that I want to work on by around January or February.

FYI - This is just a temporary page. (I didn't feel like figuring out Jekyll's drafts feature at the moment.)
