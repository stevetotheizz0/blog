Its been a while since I posted on here, but I have a bunch of updates coming.<br /><br />Here are a few topics that I plan to post about:<br /><br /><br /><u>Mumbai's Eastern Waterfront:</u><br /><br />I've been working with a group to develop a possible future plan for the development of Mumbai's eastern waterfront. &nbsp;Over recent years India's government officials have begun to seriously consider opening up at least 1,000 acres of this underutilized area to future public development.<br /><br />Out work has included analysis of existing conditions, research on site, and we are currently working on a future master plan for the development of the area.<br /><br />Our work is part of a series of studio workshops that will be published online at: <a href="http://resilientwaterfronts.org/">http://resilientwaterfronts.org/</a><br /><br /><br /><u>Building "From Scratch"</u><br /><br />I'll be writing about a few sources and methods to creating data for analysis in areas where GIS and other data might be commonly available. &nbsp;I'll look at sources such as OSM, Google's APIs, digitizing and image classification, on site data collection. &nbsp;Additionally I'll cover some examples of interpreting data, forecasts and reports into tailored graphs and visualizations.<br /><br /><u>Site Planning</u><br /><u><br /></u>Some samples of an introduction to site planning. &nbsp;Includes applications in CAD, Sketchup and creating a 3D site model.<br /><br /><u>"What Lies Beneath"</u><br /><u><br /></u>My summer photography project has been finalized and I will be running prints in December. &nbsp;Photos of the final product and related activities will be posted soon. <br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, I've found some pretty stark differences between looking something up online, and seeing it in person. &nbsp;Here's one illustration of what I found:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yDfrRnrJ5vI/Vjjw3MdpMLI/AAAAAAAABmA/JAaK8a_ZwtM/s1600/ResearchComparison.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yDfrRnrJ5vI/Vjjw3MdpMLI/AAAAAAAABmA/JAaK8a_ZwtM/s640/ResearchComparison.jpg" width="492" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
