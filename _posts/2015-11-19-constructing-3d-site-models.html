I am currently going through some of the introductory aspects of site planning. The process has shown how useful it is to create a 3D model in order to gain some insight into the scale of an area and its surroundings.<br /><div><br /></div><div>As an exercise I am studying the area at 11th and Market, which is currently the site of the proposed East Market development currently under construction:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="http://6abc.com/video/embed/?pid=848223" width="476"></iframe>  <br /><br /></div><br /><div><br />I quickly took the building footprints layer and through a series of steps exported the layers from GIS to Sketchup. I then just extruded the layers up to the total building heights. Sketchup is pretty amazing and with a little more time, you can really make some great 3D renderings of a concept. This model was a quick, simple example to create a sense of scale for the area. (For city hall, I went ahead and grabbed a previously built model, that had some finer details of the building from Sketchup's model warehouse and scale it into this model.)<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="326" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/embed.html?mid=u5ce4fb80-a9ac-4b53-b6dc-572876bc3736&amp;width=580&amp;height=326" width="480"></iframe> <br /><br />In addition to the 3D model that you can zoom in and view, I also placed the building footprints into Auto CAD, and laid out a template to send to our laser cutter. A number of layers were set up to score the building footprints in the base, and also cut out a number of layers of the footprints themselves to glue and stack on one another. &nbsp;Pictured below are a few photos of the before and after process of creating the model from 1/16" chipboard.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fbFjQahaoZE/Vk6Hm6pMzTI/AAAAAAAABmY/IWQOBE9fK64/s1600/image.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fbFjQahaoZE/Vk6Hm6pMzTI/AAAAAAAABmY/IWQOBE9fK64/s320/image.jpeg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div>
